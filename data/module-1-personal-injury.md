> Classification: Internal-Only

## What is Personal Injury?

When an accident happens, victims don't immediately settle with the liable party. They look for an attorney to help them get better compensation for the injuries, mentally and physically.

## How Personal Injury Works

**Flow of Personal Injury Process:**

1. **Initial Contact**
   - Victim/Injured Person seeks help from a Personal Injury Lawyer

2. **Legal Representation**
   - Personal Injury Lawyer evaluates and accepts the case
   - Case proceeds in one of two directions:

3. **Case Processing**
   - **Pre-Litigation Path**: Attempting to settle before filing a lawsuit
   - **Litigation Path**: Proceeding with formal lawsuit when settlement isn't possible

4. **Ardent Support**
   - Provides specialized paralegal assistance during pre-litigation

5. **External Interactions**
   - Government Entities: Handling government-related claims and requirements
   - Insurance Companies: Negotiating with insurers for fair compensation
   - Medical Providers: Coordinating with healthcare providers for treatment and documentation

## Personal Injury

- An area of law that protects individuals from injury that results from another person or party's negligence, malpractice, or any act of wrong doing.

## Elements of NEGLIGENCE in a Personal Injury Case

a. **Duty of Care**
   - The defendant had a legal responsibility to act in a way that would prevent foreseeable harm to the plaintiff.

b. **Breach of Duty**
   - The defendant failed to uphold their duty of care by acting or failing to act in a manner that a reasonable person would in similar circumstances.

c. **Causation**
   - The defendant's breach of duty directly caused the plaintiff's injuries.

d. **Damages**
   - This refers to the actual harm or losses suffered by the injured person (the plaintiff) as a direct result of the defendant's negligence.

## Statute of Limitations (SOL)

A law that sets the maximum amount of time those parties in a dispute have to initiate legal proceedings.

The length of time allowed under a statute of limitations varies depending upon the type of Personal Injury Case.
