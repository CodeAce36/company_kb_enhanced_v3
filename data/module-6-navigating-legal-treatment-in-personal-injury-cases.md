# Navigating Legal Treatment in Personal Injury Cases
> Classification: Internal-Only

## Why Treatment is important?

The treatment stage in a personal injury case is vital for several reasons:

- **Health and Recovery:** Prioritizes the injured individual's health and recovery, preventing further complications and facilitating a faster recovery process.
- **Documentation:** Generates crucial documentation of the injuries, establishing causation and quantifying damages sought in the claim.
- **Legal Strategy:** Informs legal strategy, aiding negotiation with the at-fault party's insurance company or preparation for trial if necessary.

**Key Point:** The most important thing an injury victim can do is to seek medical care as soon as possible after the injury occurs. Delaying medical treatment can give insurance claims adjusters a pretext to deny a claim or minimize the payout.

## Treatment Plan = Case Strategy

Personal Injury Lawyers' goal is to get the maximum amount or the full policy limits of the defendant's insurance coverage. As case managers, we strategize to maximize the value of a case to reach that goal.

## Building a Case Strategy or Working up a Case

In a Personal Injury case, Case Managers (CMs) tailor their approach depending on the category the case falls under:

1. **Fast Turn Case**
   - **Quick Settlements:** Often occurring in cases where the client's injuries clearly exceed the insurance policy limits of the at-fault party.
   - **Evidence:** Pictures alone can suffice.

2. **MIST Case (Minor Impact Soft Tissue)**
   - **Low-Speed Impacts:** Resulting in minor property damage but soft-tissue injuries.
   - **Insurance Adjuster View:** Often seen as low value, which may be reflected in their settlement offer.

3. **A-Case**
   - **Significant Injuries:** Involving serious injuries such as brain or spinal cord injuries, leading to high medical bills.
   - **High Damages:** Categorized as "high damages" cases, with policy limits typically being $100,000.00 or more.

## E=MC² in Personal Injury Cases

E=MC² represents key factors:

1. **1st Party:** Client's Uninsured Motorist (UM) or Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage.
2. **3rd Party:** Defendant's Policy Limit.
3. **PD (Property Damage):** Severity of vehicle damage, categorized as minor, moderate, major, or total loss.
4. **Injury:** Injuries sustained in the accident, categorized by the following:
   - **Subjective Complaints:** Symptoms reported by the injured party.
   - **Objective Findings:** Medical conditions diagnosed by a doctor.
5. **Liability:** Negligence responsibility for the injury, categorized as clear, disputed, or denied.

## Types of Compensatory Damages

### Special / Economic Damages
1. Medical Treatment/Expenses
2. Lost Income
3. Property Loss/Damage

### General / Economic Damages
1. Pain and Suffering
2. Emotional Distress
3. Loss of Enjoyment
4. Loss of Consortium

## Case Categories

In a Personal Injury case, CMs work up the Client's case depending upon the category a case falls under.

**REMEMBER:**
You can classify a case and identify its category, using the E=mc2 equation.

## E=MC2 Examples:

1. **Fast Turn Case Example:**
   - 1st Party: $30,000.00 / $60,000.00
   - 3rd Party: $50,000.00 / $100,000.00
   - PD: Total wrecked
   - Injury: Fatal
   - Liability: Clear (rear-end collision)
   - **Summary:** Low policy limits. Fatality is clearly worth more than the limit of the defendant's insurance policy. Quick settlement.

2. **MIST Case Example:**
   - 1st Party: $15,000.00 / $30,000.00
   - 3rd Party: $10,000.00 / $20,000.00
   - PD: Minor (no visible damage)
   - Injury: Neck & back pain
   - Liability: Clear
   - **Summary:** Minor property damage. Minor/Soft Tissue Injury. Low Policy Limits.

3. **A-Case Example:**
   - 1st Party: N/A
   - 3rd Party: $5,000,000.00 or more
   - PD: N/A
   - Injury: Fractured ankle & dislocated wrist
   - Liability: Clear (visible wet floor)
   - **Summary:** Major injury that can result in surgical treatment, High policy limits, and clear liability

## Treatment Process

### Fast Turn Case Treatment

No treatment from lien providers needed, the case can be settled just based on the facts and photos. The plaintiff will only treat with non-lien providers.

**Remember:**
Hospital or Emergency Rooms may have a separate billing for emergency surgery treatment called TRAUMA or SURGERY BILL.

### MIST Case Treatment

## MIST Case Treatment Flowchart

**Treatment Flow:**

1. **First Treatment after accident**
   - Emergency Room/Urgent Care/PCP

2. **Specialist Evaluation**
   - Orthopedic or Pain Management (1st appointment)
   - Assessment results in two parallel paths:
     
3. **Therapy Path**
   - Chiropractic or Physical Therapy (8 or more sessions)
   
4. **Imaging Path**
   - Initial X-rays
   
5. **Follow-up (2nd Appointment)**
   - Review of progress
   - Review of initial imaging
   - Recommendations for continued treatment
   
6. **Additional Treatment**
   - More Physical Therapy or Chiropractic sessions
   - Advanced imaging (X-ray/MRI/CT Scan)
   
7. **Final Evaluation (3rd Appointment)**
   - Review of all treatment and imaging
   - Procedure recommendations if needed

**Initial Treatment:**
Ideally, the first treatment would be provided by non-lien providers, such as ambulance services, emergency room/hospital visit, urgent care, or visiting their primary care physician (PCP). These initial providers offer immediate medical attention and assessment of injuries sustained from the personal injury accident.

**First Lien Provider Appointment:**
The first appointment with a lien provider involves seeing an orthopedic doctor or pain management specialist for an initial consultation regarding the plaintiff's injuries. After the initial evaluation, the orthopedic doctor or pain management specialist may recommend further treatment.

**Second Lien Provider Appointment:**
Following the initial consultation, the plaintiff may be referred to chiropractic treatment or physical therapy by the orthopedic doctor or pain management specialist. These treatments aim to address the underlying injuries and facilitate recovery.

**Imaging:**
As part of the treatment plan, including chiropractic treatment or physical therapy, the orthopedic doctor or pain management specialist may recommend imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to further evaluate the extent of the plaintiff's injuries.

**Follow-up Evaluation:**
After completing chiropractic treatment and obtaining imaging studies, the plaintiff returns to the orthopedic doctor or pain management specialist for a follow-up evaluation. During this appointment, the doctor reviews the results of the imaging studies and the progress of chiropractic treatment/physical therapy, and may recommend continued treatment as needed.

**Treatment in A-Cases**

A-Cases refer to cases where the injuries sustained by the client are more severe and require extensive medical treatment. The treatment process in A-Cases involves several stages and coordination with various healthcare providers to ensure the client receives comprehensive care. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Medical Evaluation**
   - **Emergency Room (ER) Visit:** Immediately after the accident, the client may be taken to the ER for an initial evaluation and treatment. This is crucial for addressing any life-threatening injuries and stabilizing the client.
   - **Primary Care Physician (PCP) Visit:** After the ER visit, the client should follow up with their PCP for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss ongoing treatment needs.

2. **Specialist Referrals**
   - **Orthopedic Specialist:** If the client has sustained bone fractures, joint injuries, or other musculoskeletal issues, they will be referred to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
   - **Neurologist:** For head injuries, concussions, or nerve damage, the client may need to see a neurologist to assess and manage their condition.
   - **Pain Management:** The client may receive medications or other treatments to manage pain and inflammation. This can include prescription painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroid injections.

3. **Diagnostic Testing**
   - **Imaging Studies:** The client may undergo various imaging studies such as X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans to diagnose the extent of their injuries and guide treatment decisions.

4. **On-going Medical Treatment**
   - **Surgical Interventions:** In some cases, surgery may be required to repair severe injuries. This could involve procedures such as fracture repair, joint reconstruction, or spinal surgery.
   - **Chiropractic Care:** For clients with back or neck injuries, chiropractic care can provide relief through spinal adjustments and other manual therapies.
   - **Physical Therapy:** Continued physical therapy sessions to improve strength, flexibility, and range of motion. The therapist will adjust the treatment plan as the client progresses.

5. **Follow-Up Appointments**
   - **Regular Check-Ups:** The client will have regular follow-up appointments with their healthcare providers to monitor their progress and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment plan.
   - **Specialist Consultations:** Ongoing consultations with specialists to address any complications or new symptoms that arise during the recovery process.
