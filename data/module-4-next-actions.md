## Next Action Items

These are the day-to-day tasks on each case, It sets forth the list of items the Case Manager must complete in which require immediate action.

1. **Get Acknowledgement Letters**
   - Acknowledgement Letters are requested to insurance carriers to confirm that they have received the LOR.

2. **Request a Copy of the Declarations Page (Dec Page)**
   - Dec Page summarizes the information essential to a person's insurance coverage.
   - It is requested to insurance carriers to confirm the limits for each coverage.

   **NOTE:**
   - We request Declaration Page of the Client IMMEDIATELY after the LOR was sent.
   - Insurance Carriers of the defendant usually don't provide Dec Page.

3. **Confirm Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM)**
   1. In car accident cases, clients will often have what is called UM/UIM coverage through their own insurance company. This will provide the client coverage for their medical bills and pain and suffering if the Defendant does not have insurance or not enough insurance to cover the client's damages.
   2. Client's Dec Page will show us exactly the types of coverage a client has including UM/UIM limits.
   3. It is important to check if the date of the incident falls within the policy period stated on Declarations Page. Cause if not, then the client is considered a Prop213.

## Prop 213

In an auto accident, Prop 213 prevents drivers, injured in a car accident, from obtaining non-economic damages (e.g. pain and suffering) even when the accident was not their fault if they lack car insurance or the car they were driving was not covered by insurance.

**REMEMBER Prop 213 does not apply:**
1. To passengers
2. To a parked vehicle
3. If the Defendant was considered DUI (driving under influence)

## Uninsured Motorist (UM)
- UM coverage helps the client pay for damages caused by a negligent driver who doesn't have a valid auto insurance coverage.

## Underinsured Motorist (UIM)
- UIM coverage, on the other hand, steps in when an at-fault driver has liability limits that are too low to cover the medical expenses of the client.

**NOTE:**
In Nevada, UM & UIM limits becomes an additional limits to claim on top of the Defendant's coverage.

4. **Policy Limits (PL) Search or Insurance Search on the Defendant**
   a. PL is the liability coverage of the at-fault driver. It is the highest amount the other party will pay for a claim.
   b. More often than not, we want to know the defendant's insurance policy limits in order to work up a case. We need to prevent situations where the client accumulates huge medical bills on a case when there is only a little amount of insurance limits we can recover.

## Ways to locate Defendant's Insurance

1. **Phishing Letter to Defendant**
   - This is a letter we send directly to the at-fault driver, asking for his insurance information.
   - This is a friendly letter rather than a threat, since most defendants get scared easily when receiving a letter from an attorney's office.
   - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he's paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions.

2. **Insurance Request Through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**
   - This is a letter we send directly to the at-fault driver, asking for his insurance information.
   - This is a friendly letter rather than a threat, since most defendants get scared easily when receiving a letter from an attorney's office.
   - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he's paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions.

3. **Insurance Search Through Online Portals**
   - This is a letter we send directly to the at-fault driver, asking for his insurance information.
   - This is a friendly letter rather than a threat, since most defendants get scared easily when receiving a letter from an attorney's office.
   - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he's paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
If the accident happened in Nevada and Texas, Insurance Companies are required to provide the Policy Limits (PL) of their insured/defendant within 30 days from the date of the accident.

5. **Request Medical Records (MR) and Billing Records (BR)**
   - If a client went to a hospital (ER) or was transported by an ambulance, Medical Records & Billing records should be requested from the providers after confirming that there is an available UM/UIM coverage.
   - All these are being requested separately even if the client just went to one hospital.

**Always remember that Hospital charges may come in three separate billing records:**
1. Emergency/Hospital bill
2. Radiology bill
3. Physician's bill

- In case of Emergency Surgery, Ask if there's a Trauma Bill or Surgery Bill.
- On the other hand, medical records and billing records from lien doctors are being requested after every visit.
- For lien providers requests are just made through a phone call or email.
