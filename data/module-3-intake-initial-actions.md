# Intake & Initial Action Items
> Classification: Internal-Only

## Intake Stage

- This is the very start of a case. A potential client will call the attorney office with a new potential case.
- The firm either accepts or rejects the case. If the case is accepted, we begin the Intake Process which consists of gathering pieces of information about the client and the case.
- This includes personal information, insurance information, incident information, treatment physicians/hospitals, and also the defendant's information.

## Initial Actions Items

- These are initial list of tasks to be done within 24-48 hours from the day a case has been assigned.
- Initial action items vary depending upon the type of Personal Injury Case.

## Initial Action Items

1. **Send Welcome Letter**
   - This is a letter we initially send to ALL new clients, simply to welcome them.

2. **Send Letters of Representation (LOR)**
   - This is a letter we send to ALL insurance carriers involved in the case, making them aware that a client is represented by an attorney.

### How to file a claim?
- Call the claims department of the insurance carrier involved.

  - Date of birth
  - Address
  - Date of Incident
  - Policy Number
  - Brief description of what happened
  - Description of injuries and treatment

- Adjuster's Information:
  - Name
  - Direct phone number and/or extension number
  - Fax number

  - Email

#### LOR to Auto Insurance Carriers

  - **Things to remember in filing a claim:**
    - Be as general as possible. Most especially on the description of the accident and treatment.
    - NEVER provide the client's Social Security Number (SSN).
    - Once there is already a claim number, get the insurance adjuster's information in order to send LOR.

**REMEMBER:**
Every state has different law imposed by the government. Therefore, you need to use the proper language/LOR template based on the state where the accident happened.
- Upon receipt of LOR, insurance adjusters are prohibited to contact our client directly.

3. **Send Preservation Letter**
   - **LOR to Premise Insurance Carriers**
     - This is a letter we send to ensure that they maintain the video footage related to the accident and to request their insurance information.

     - It is important to send this letter immediately as premises often just save video surveillance footages within 30days.
     - Sending this letter also preserves any incident reports available.

     - For auto cases, where a truck is involved in the accident.
     - Preservation letter is sent because most trucks do have dashcam.

## What is a Lien?

- LIEN refers to a legal claim or legal right which is made against the assets that are held as collaterals for satisfying a debt.
- A medical lien is any demand for repayment for medical services that can be placed against the settlement money paid out in a personal injury case.
- The health insurance company's stance is that if someone else is at fault for your injuries and you receive compensation from that negligent party, they, as your health insurer, should be reimbursed for the portion of the medical expenses they covered originally.
- Liens providers are the doctors specialized in personal injury and are already affiliated with the firm.

## What is Subrogation?

- Subrogation is when the client's health insurance company seeks reimbursement for the payment they made on behalf of the client's medical expenses incurred by hospitals, doctors, and therapists.
- If our client got treatment through an Ambulance, in an emergency room, urgent care or through his primary care physician, the health insurance pays for the charges.
