# Demand Letter Drafting
> Classification: Internal-Only

A "Demand Letter" or "Demand" is a letter to the defendant's or plaintiffs insurance company. It details the entire case and requests money to settle the case.

Formal document sent by the injured party or their attorney to the insurance company representing the at-fault party. This letter outlines the details of the accident, the injuries sustained by the claimant, the damages incurred (both economic and non-economic), and a demand for compensation to cover these damages.

How we request money in a Demand will vary and is determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Types of Demand Letters

1. **Demand for a Specific Dollar Amount**
   a. A type of Demand where the claimant asks for a specific dollar amount or listing a range of amounts that he is willing to accept to settle the case.
   b. This is usually sent when the claimant's damages doesn't each the maximum value of a case.

2. **Policy Limits Demand**
   a. A request made to an insurance company to pay the maximum amount an insurer has in their policy.
   b. This is sent to the insurance company when the claimant has already reached the maximum case value.

3. **Demand for Offer**
   a. A type of Demand where we ask the insurance company to make an initial offer, based on all the documents provided.

## Elements of a Demand

1. **Liability Section**
   - The liability section of a Demand is where the conduct of the defendant is detailed.
   - Just because you're injured does not mean that you are entitled to money in a lawsuit.
   - You have to show that the person who hurt you engaged in some type of wrongful conduct. Fault matters.

   **The liability section consists of:**
   - The date, time, and location of the accident
   - A description of the accident to establish responsibility for the accident

2. **Causation Section**

   **The causation section should have the following:**
   - **Mechanism of Injury (MOI)**: Explain how the forces of impact damaged the human body directly.
   - **Body Movement**: Describe what physically happened to the client (the body's movement) at the precise moment of the incident.
   - **Injury Link**: Establish whether that movement/impact caused the injuries sustained.

   **Note**: In a premises case, the Case Manager does not need to have a causation section in the Demand.

3. **Damages**
   - This is probably the most important section of the demand letter.
   - It generally consists of a medical chronology or summary.

   **Damages Section consists of:**
   - A list of injuries and symptoms following the accident
   - A description of medical diagnosis and treatment
   - A list of medical expenses

4. **Loss of Earnings**
   - Loss of Earnings Section is added in the demand when the claimant has lost earnings potential at work, as a result of an accident done by another person's fault.

   **This can be claimed:**
   - The claimant has been absent from work as a result of an accident.
   - Or if the claimant is still able to work after your accident, but perhaps can only work shorter shifts as a result of his injuries.
   - It is usually assessed by providing the net average monthly wage for at least 3 months prior to the accident in order to calculate the average salary.

5. **Loss of Consortium**
   - Loss of Consortium Section is added in the Demand if the claimant is married.
   - This is a part where the husband or wife, who was not involved in the incident, can sue the defendant for the loss of love, society, compassion etc. because of the injury to their spouse.

   **The Demand Letter should set forth:**
   - how long the couple has been together and married
   - if they have kids

6. **Physical Pain, Mental Suffering, Emotional Distress**
   - Physical Pain, Mental Suffering, Emotional Distress is a separate section in the Demand that is essentially for pain and suffering damages.
   - It should include a statement of the law and a description of how the injury affected the client's life.
